## 🎯 Project Goals

The goal of this project was to build a full-featured recipe management application while strengthening my front-end development skills and gaining hands-on experience with real-world integrations.

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Build reusable and responsive UI components using React.
- Implement **responsive web design** to ensure a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Implement secure authentication and authorization using Firebase.
- Manage user-specific data, including favorites and author-based access control.
- Integrate third-party APIs such as the Web Speech API for voice search and the Gemini API for AI-powered recipe summarization.
- Implement advanced features like multi-level filtering, search functionality, timers, and print-friendly views.
- Handle CRUD operations effectively with proper data validation and access restrictions.
- Improve overall application performance, usability, and user experience.

This project aimed to simulate a real-world application by combining modern front-end technologies, cloud services, and AI features into a single, scalable solution.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Styling:** CSS3 / Tailwind CSS
- **APIs:** dummyjson, {JSON} Placeholder
- **Libraries:** React-Router-Dom, React-Redux, react-spinners, react-timer-hook, react-to-print
- **AI Tools:** WebSpeech API, Gemini API
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Backend:** Firebase

## 🤖 AI Integration (Optional)

- **Web Speech API:**  
  Enables voice-based recipe search, allowing users to search hands-free by speaking ingredients, recipe names, or cuisines. This improves accessibility and provides a faster, more interactive user experience.

- **Gemini API:**  
  Used to generate concise recipe summaries at the click of a button, helping users quickly understand the recipe without reading long instructions.

### 🚀 How It Enhances User Experience
- Makes searching easier and more accessible through voice input.
- Saves time by providing AI-generated recipe summaries.
- Adds modern, intelligent features that improve overall usability.

🎨 Design Choices

- Used a component-based architecture in React to improve code reusability and maintainability.
- Implemented responsive web design to ensure consistent user experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Chose Firebase Authentication for quick, secure, and scalable user management and store recipe details.
- Applied role-based access control, allowing only authenticated users to add or favorite recipes, and only authors to edit or delete them.
- Integrated AI features (voice search and recipe summarization) to enhance usability and modernize the application.
- Designed a clean and minimal UI to keep the focus on content and ease of navigation.

🐛 Known Issues

- Initial load time can be slightly slow due to Firebase call and API.
- Limited offline support.
- AI summarization depends on external API availability.

🔮 Future Enhancements

● Implement ratings and reviews by users.
● Improve AI features, such as ingredient-based suggestions and smart meal planning.
● Add user profile pages with saved recipes and preferences.
● Upgrade the project into a full Capstone application with role-based dashboards, admin moderation, and analytics.
